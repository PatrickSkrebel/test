The Pacers trail the Celtics 3-0 in the series before a must-win matchup in Indianapolis. Haliburton missed Game 3 with the injury, which he suffered during a Game 2 loss in Boston. The Pacers leaned on Pascal Siakam, Andrew Nembhard, T.J. McConnell and their depth in Game 3, but it wasn’t enough to hold off Boston’s rally to win. With Haliburton out for Game 4, Indiana will need a next-man-up mentality to keep its season alive.",

He was 71 years old. Walton played 10 seasons in the NBA with the Portland Trail Blazers, LA Clippers and the Boston Celtics, averaging 13.3 points, 10.5 rebounds and 3.4 assists. He earned Finals MVP after leading the Blazers to the 1977 championship and won another title with the Celtics in 1986. A two-time All-Star, Walton won the league’s Most Valuable Player award in 1978. Walton retired from the NBA after the 1987-88 season. He turned to broadcasting where he became one of the most entertaining and eccentric color commentators for NCAA and NBA telecasts. A beloved member of the NBA family, legends, current players and other members of the basketball community took to social media to pay tribute to Walton’s career and his many off-the-court contributions.",
